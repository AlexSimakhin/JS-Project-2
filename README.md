# Lectrum JS personal project

## Alex Simakhin — <a href="https://alexsimakhin.github.io/JS-Project-2/">Site Link</a>

My second personal project using JavaScript. </br>
By the logic of writing code, it is similar to the previous project. But already using asynchronous code and requests to the server.

### What skills did I get:

* Working with asynchronous code (Fetch)
* Server requests (API). Also used "Postman"
* I tried to make a high-quality project structure
